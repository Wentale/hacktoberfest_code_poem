# Hacktoberfest Code Poem

This project will create a code tone poem for Hacktoberfest. Through the contributions of others, in either poem or sound files, the end of this project will see a Code Poem that can be listened to.

[Welcome and thanks for joining in this project. What I am creating here is a collaborative code tone poem. This is a creative endeavour that is also my learning practise for using GitHub in an open project. I want to bring in people's contributions to create a tone poem based on code snippets and sound bites. These will be combined in two forms. Firstly the sound bites will be combined into a tone poem and secondly the snippets of code will be mined and put into a poetic form. ]

## Getting Started

[ The most important factor in this project is diverse contributions and no wrong answers! Please choose to contribute a code snippet (2-3 lines would be ample) or to share a sound file. ]
